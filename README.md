Case Study: How does a bike-share navigate speedy success?

## Introduction
The Cyclistic bike-share analysis is a case study that demonstrates the steps of the data analysis process: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act. I analyzed the bike trip data of Cyclistic, a fictional bike-share company in Chicago, to identify how a bike-share navigates speedy success using the R programming language.

## Scenario
I am a junior data analyst working on the marketing team at Cyclistic. Lily Moreno, director of marketing and my manager, believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, our team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently.

## Using R
