Case Study: How does a bike-share navigate speedy success?

## Introduction
The Cyclistic bike-share analysis is a case study that demonstrates the steps of the data analysis process: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act. I analyzed the bike trip data of Cyclistic, a fictional bike-share company in Chicago, to identify how a bike-share navigates speedy success using the R programming language, SQL, and Google Sheets.

## Scenario
I am a junior data analyst working on the marketing team at Cyclistic. Lily Moreno, director of marketing and my manager, believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, our team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently.

## Using R
You can view the R Markdown file [here](https://github.com/chantellegayle11/bike-share/blob/main/CaseStudy%20using%20R.Rmd) to see how I analyzed the data of Cyclistic for the year 2024. You can view the final output of the R Markdown file [here](https://chantellegayle11.github.io/bike-share/CaseStudy%20using%20R.html).

## Using SQL (BigQuery) and Google Sheets
You can view the sql file [here](https://github.com/chantellegayle11/bike-share/edit/main/Analysis%20using%20SQL.sql) to see how I analyzed the data of Cyclistic for the year 2024. Due to limitations of BigQuery Sandbox account, I decided to further explore the processed data in Google Sheets. The continuation of analysis can be viewed [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yY7enwiKjCg6Iqm9d8eyDNVASxdmUGJ-wPYdZ8cxTSI/edit?usp=sharing). In Google Sheets, I used pivot tables and charts for visualization purposes.
